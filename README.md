### About this project: :raised_hands:

> Chat Social is a multi-purpose chat application. It features most of the modern day features that a chat application has like creating channels, sending direct messages, reactions, emojis, gifs and media. We took up this project in an attempt to strengthen our knowledge and become more comfortable with React. GetStreamio provides various in-built components out of the box.
